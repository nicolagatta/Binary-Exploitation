A Sample stack canary bypass example

This example is very peculiar and the prerequisites are specific to this vulnerable program
- executes two read() (and not gets())
- print the output at every execution of read

This lead to a leak of the stack canary

Compile with:
gcc -m32 -no-pie vulnerable.c -o vulnerable -fstack-protector
