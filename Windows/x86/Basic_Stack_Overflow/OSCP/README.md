# OSCP Vulnerable Example

The vulnerable binary listens on port 1337 and has 10 vulnerable functions. The functions can be reached by specifyng the function number with the "OVERFLOW1 XXXX" 
Where XXXX is the supplied payload from users that can cause the bouffer overflow.

Each function has a different setup:
- a different buffer lenght
- a different set of character that ends the memory copy function

It is strongly suggested to use immunity debugger
The goals of this exercise is to
- find the EIP offset, i.e. the lenght of the buffer to overflow (NN-find-offset.py)
- find a usable JMP ESP address (with immunity debugger mona module "!mona jmp -r esp")
- find the bad characters that the copy function strips (or terminate copy) (NN-find-badchars.py)
- create a suitable shellcode (with msfvenom)
- get a reverse tcp shell with nc.exe (NN-final-exploit.py
