## Basic Stack overflow

Based on TryHackme room 

The vulnerable binary listnes on port and has 10 vulnerable functions
The functions can be reaceh by specifyng the function number with the "OVERFLOW [0-9]+" 
Control pass to the function that expects further input for the overflow.
Each function has a different setup:
- a different buffer lenght
- a different set of character that ends the memory copy function

The goals of this exercise is to
- find a usable  JMP ESP address
- find the bad acharacters
- create a suitable shellcode
- get a reverse tcp shell
